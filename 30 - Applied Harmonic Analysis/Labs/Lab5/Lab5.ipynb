As mentioned in the lab, the problem of minimizing $|x|_1$ subject to the constraint $Ax=y$ can be transformed into a linear programming problem. Specifically, we define $x=u-v$ where $u_j=x_j^{+}$ and $v_j=x_j^{-}$.

In Python, we can use the standard linear programming solver linprog to solve this problem. First, we define a vector called $c$, which in this case consists of ones since we aim to minimize the given objective. Additionally, we include the matrix $A$ and the vector $y$. Running the solver provides us with the vector $x$, which represents the polynomial coefficients with the smallest $\\ell^1$ norm.
